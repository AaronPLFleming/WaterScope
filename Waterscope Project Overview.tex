Project Management Plan

Our project outline will be centred on the following Gantt chart, which details the specific tasks to be completed by certain dates. 

We are using Slack for all project communication, both between team members and to communicate with the team at Waterscope. 

Github is being used for all file uploads, to track progress and changes made by individual group members, and to show who has contributed to which parts of the group projects.

We plan to complete the first project proposal collaboratively, by working on separate parts, uploading them to GIT and then adding and editing the work of our peers as we best see fit.


The following Gantt Chart, team strengths and training plans detail the key points of the project management plan to be discussed.

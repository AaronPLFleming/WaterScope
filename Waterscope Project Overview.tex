\section{Proposal}
\subsection{Overview, Context and Approach}
\subsubsection{Waterscope}
Waterscope is a small company formed in 2015 to attempt to combat the lack of access to safe drinking water. Currently, waterborne diseases from bacteria results in over 2.2 million deaths per year - the aim of Waterscope is to devise a simple, fast, water testing kit which can be used to quantitatively test water sources on site for bacterial levels within a few hours.
\subsubsection{The Problem}
As part of this testing kit, water is filtered through an extremely fine filter, which collects (some of) the bacteria. However, the current system (using a syringe) is slow and energetic, and therefore unsuitable for widespread use by people of a variety of strengths and abilities etc. The task of our team is to design a mechanism for filtering that allows a more rapid, and easier, method of passing the required volume of water ($\approx 100$ml) through the filter.\\
A second issue regarding this system is cost. While the overall testing apparatus can be of a reasonable cost (several $\pounds$100), the components used for filtering (which, since they require sterility, are designed to be disposable) must be very cheap. This makes the current solution of a syringe impractical, since even the relatively low cost of a syringe ($\approx$ 50p) is prohibitive.
\subsubsection{Approaches}
Two main approaches occurred to us. The first option was to consider a different syringe-like device which allows the application of a greater force, thereby increasing flow rate. However, we reasoned that this would be even more expensive than the original solution - designing our own custom syringe is unlikely to be of a practical cost.\\
The second idea, and the idea which the WaterScope team recommended that we pursue, was to design a vacuum filtering system. We decided that it would be relatively feasible to design a cheap vacuum pump that is cheap and easy to manufacture, ideally in-country, as well as a sealed interface between filter and collection vessel. We plan to use a glass flask as our collection vessel for now, in the understanding that modifications could be made relatively easily in the future by the WaterScope team if a glass flask proves to be impractical. The benefit of this solution is, in theory, its low cost - since the pump and flask both lie downstream of the filter (as well as large portions of our proposed interface system), they are not required to be disposable and therefore are permitted to be more expensive.

\subsubsection{Skills/Training Required}

During the course of the 4 week project, the whole team will be required to draw up upon both technical and team working skills. However, we recognise that to produce the best possible outcome we will benefit from certain members also learning a number of new skills for specialised tasks. Examples of beneficial skills are as follows:  

\begin{itemize}
\item CAD/modelling: Computer aided design is the most efficient method for creating any models of proposed designs, due to it's easy to refine/edit nature. We anticipate initial design ideas being expressed via hand drawings but the skill of translating the best contenders into CAD models quickly and accurately will likely prove valuable when determining the performance and manufacturing feasibility of our design ideas. 
\item 3D printing/rapid-protyping: The ability to create physical models of our designs is going to be essential in not only testing but realising our designs. The 3D printers available to in the department are a fantastic tool for creating complex geometries quickly and over the course of the project most members of our group will learn/utilise the skill of turning CAD models into products using 3D printing. 
\item Laser/plasma cutter: We also anticipate the need to use other manufacturing methods when making our prototypes, and will endeavor to learn the skills to use the Dyson Centre's cutting tools if the need arises. 
\item Web Design: Our final proposal will be presented in the form of a website that provides a detailed but intuitive overview of the teams progress towards a solution. This will require coding skills in languages such as HTML and Javascript, and graphic/user interface design skills to make sure the website functions ideally and is easy for the end user to navigate.  
\end{itemize}
 
\n We also anticipate our proficiency when functioning as a team will depend greatly on certain 'soft skills' such as: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Time Management - Gantt Chart 
\item Communication Skills - slack 
\item Workload sharing/delegation - Github 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costing \& Parts}

As discussed in the introduction, two approaches were initially investigated for feasability. As part of this investigation, the rough costs assoaciated with these different methods were calculated. 

\subsubsection{Method 1 - The Syringe Method}
The syringe method would make use of the current system implemented by WaterScope, with the addition of a mechanism (such as a Vice) which would enable a larger force to be applied to the syringe, whilst requiring less physical effort. The axxporimate costings for this can be seen in \ref{table:1}

\subsubsection{Method 2 - The Vacuum Method}

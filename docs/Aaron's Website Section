\subsection Features of the Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A fancy formatted figure with the following points ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsubsection Hand Pump
+ Simple + Resilient
+ Extremely modular
+ Low cost

\subsubsection Vacuum Flask
+ Off-the-shelf component
- Far above-spec

\subsubsection Water Filtration Unit (Syringe + Luer Lock Filter Holder)
+ Modular design
+ Simple to Operate
-+ Moderate Flow Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Hand Pump - This was selected as a basic component deisgned to achieve the bare minimum, but proved to be the perfect component for the design aims, being cheap, simple to operate, sturdy and widely compatible.
            - Another avenue explored was that of re-purposing a standard bike pump, but as our current pump achieved the desired purpose perfectly, this was not explored further. It would, however, be a cheap and simple modification to a pump.
- Vacuum Gauge - This is a non-essential component - since sufficient vacuum can be extremely easily generated, measuring the vacuum is largely not required. Additionally, it is easy to assess strength of vacuum according to how difficult the hand pump is to operate.
- Vacuum Flask - Could be replaced by a more resiliant plastic flask.
               - This is the most expensive component of our design, but since it is reusable (without sterilisation), this was not a prohibitive cost.
               - Includes bung with a drilled hole of suitable size for the water filtration unit.
- Water Filtration Unit - This final design was selected in order to be the most compatible with the other work that WaterScope has done.
                        - The flow rates can be found in the "Testing of Solution" section; These were slower than with our previous designs, which used a 3D-printed component, but this faster flow was sacrificed in order to ensure maximal compatibility with WaterScope.

                                <h2>End User Perspective (Sajan)</h2>
                                <h3>End User Workflow</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Although the current end user is the Waterscope team, the eventual aim is to pass on a functioning water filtration system to locals, so that they can test the water sources themselves. In light of this, our team has tried to incorporate the current prototype created into the working day of an end user, as if it were the final product. One minor adaptation has been made, to have the pump connected to several vacuum flasks, as we envisage it would be in the field.
                                    <br>Seeing the product from the end user perspective is crucial, both to better understand where it is at its most useful, and also where the largest gains can be made in future development.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The current workflow employed by WaterScope in Tanzania (i.e. using a sterile syringe to manually push 100ml of water through the filter) can be summarised in the schematic below.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row section-container-spacer">
                                        <div class="col-md-12">
                                            <img class="img-responsive" src="./assets/Waterscope-Current.png">

                                <p>
                                    If our prototype was incorporated by any end user, the workflow is largely the same, with the changes from the above workflow outlined in red and the advantages and disadvantages explained below.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row section-container-spacer">

                                    Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the end user workflow in comparison to the current WaterScope workflow include:

                                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                                    </div>
                                    <ul>

                                            Multiple Samples can be filtered in parallel either on site (especially if there are lots of water samples in close proximity) or in the lab.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Less energy is required to operate the vacuum system, such that it does not vary with human factors (e.g. variability in strength)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Once the vacuum filtration apparatus is set up it only needs intermittent monitoring to ensure there is no leak, so the user can concentrate on other tasks e.g. extracting water samples from other sources close by.
                                        </li>

                                        <li>
                                            The vacuum apparatus must be set up at each site, which may be time consuming and/or inconvenient depending on the location.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The vacuum apparatus must be taken with the rest of the equipment for the day. This may be a problem as it is somewhat bulky and fragile, so the end user must be careful for it not to get damaged. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            A large proportion of the equipment is unlikely to be readily available at a reasonable price in Tanzania, leading to high transport costs and the practicality issues of transport from source.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                            This concludes this section and brings us onto the user assistance documentation and cost benefit analysis of modifications to our product, which we hope will address some of the disadvantages discussed.

                                    Having created a functional prototype, we created documentation to assist the end user in assembling our prototype as if it were to be taken to Tanzania immediately, in the form of a demonstration video (edited by Nathan) and a set of pictorial assembly instructions.

                            <p>
                                During our 4 week project working with WaterScope we were able to make a functioning prototype which proves that vacuum filtration is a viable solution that could be used in the field today. It solves the problem of a long strenuous filtering procedure in a way that is affordable and easy to transport and assemble. However, we appreciate that there are numerous simple adaptations that can be be made to improve it further. 
                            </p>
                            <div class="row section-container-spacer">
                                <div class="col-md-12">

                            <p>
                                One of the greatest strengths that our vacuum filtration prototype exhibits is fantastic modularity, with there being many different parts that could replace the 3 main components in our design: the pump, the vacuum flask and the water holder, many of which are cheap and readily available. The end user of our product could therefore pick from a list of compatible components to tailor it to their specific needs and the parts they have access to.
                            </p>
                            <div class="row section-container-spacer">
                                    <div class="col-md-12">
                                            <img class="img-responsive" src="./nathanimgs/pump.png">
                                    </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The pump we used in our final prototype worked great. It is a standard hand pump, often marketed for syphoning purposes and had a vacuum function integrated. It can be bought individually in the UK for under £5, a price that would reduce further with a bulk purchase. The fact that such a basic pump functioned perfectly, creating 12 psi pressure differences with minimal effort, gives us confidence to assert that this is a good option, but is by no means the only pump that can be used in this case. Most common hand/foot pumps have a vacuum function so they could be used in much the same way that we used ours. Pump that don't have such a function out of the box, such as a common bike pump, can often be easily adapted to do so. Therefore, we see the final version of the product functioning with whatever pump is available to end user in Tanzania.

                                Next the vacuum chamber, which has the only constraints that it needs to have 2 inputs channels and be rigid enough to hold its shape under a vacuum. The input channels serve and a connection point for the filter holder assembly and for the piping to the vacuum pump. The Buchner flask we used in our final prototype was highly specialised for this task, being a piece of relatively expensive chemistry lab equipment, and we believe it is overkill for a product designed to do this task in the field. A polypropylene vacuum flask would be an easy substitution and instantly reduce costs and increase durability. Furthermore, if the the end user cannot source such an item, they could reasonably modify any rigid container to act as the vacuum chamber, such as jerry can or a barrel. This would take some work but once done, this component would have an incredibly long life span and would likely never need to be replaced. The use of commonly available rubber would be sufficient to provide a tight seal in any input channels, for if bungs like we used are also difficult to source. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of vacuum filtrations greatest strengths is how scalable it is, as if you create a chamber with a given negative pressure, the filtering time should be independent to the number of filter papers that are subjected to the vacuum. Therefore, you can add multiple filter paper/water sample inlet channels to the chamber, and filter them all in parallel. If the end user has to test multiple samples in a day this could prove to be a massive time saver and could be achieved with either an off the shelf or custom made vacuum manifold. This would increase the complexity and upfront cost of the system but this could be justified if the time saving was great enough, and it could also open up new testing possibilities such as screening for more chemicals or minerals other than just bacteria.
                            </p>

                                    <div class="col-md-12">
                                            <img class="img-responsive" src="./nathanimgs/waterholder.png">

                            <p>
                                Finally the sample holder, since this part is above the filter paper, all it has to do is contain the water sample, feeding it through as the sample is vacuumed. Therefore, this component can conceptually be very simple, thus the 50p syringe body we used in our final prototype could be overkill and potentially be replaced by a cheaper container that is easy to source in the destination of use (Tanzania). This includes standard water bottles when used in conjunction with an adapter lid such as readily available Luer lock adapter lids. These bottles would also be suitable for the collection of the water sample, negating the need for a separate sterile beaker (like is used in the current WaterScope workflow, reducing costs and waste.
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                                A more novel idea we had for when filtering near more accessible water sources was to just use tubing or even a straw directly into the source. This approach could potentially be an incredibly cheap solution however testing has not yet been conducted as to the viability of this concept, and it could run into issues such as determining the volume of water that has been filtered. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, cold water sterilisation had been identified early on in the project as an intriguing proposition in this context, which had not yet been explored by WaterScope. All parts before the filter paper are currently disposable as they need to be sterile before the filtration process. This brings multiple issues such as cost, transporting and disposing of these high volume disposable components. Being able to sterilise in the field would largely eradicate these problems, and since we calculate the cost per sterilisation being under 10p, this could also prove to the method that gives the lowest variable cost per filtration to the end user.

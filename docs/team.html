              <h2>Project Management (Sajan)</h2>
              <p>
                  Management of the tasks required for a successful project with WaterScope was crucial, especially as we had a large group size. We decided to create a Gantt Chart during the first week, so that we could allocate the tasks evenly and set achievable deadlines for the members of the group. This was then uploaded to our collaborative online space GitHub, such that it could clearly be seen and the changes tracked by all group members. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Gantt Chart was updated intermittently during group discussions, and <b>milestone updates can be found available on our GitHub repository with the date created</b>. The final week of the project involved a large deal of collaborative work when testing and modelling the prototype, so there was less of a definitive task split between the group.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <b>Key differences between the initial plan set out and the updated Gantt Chart (these can be seen in dark green on the updated Gantt Chart):</b>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                    There was a delay of 4 days in the arrival of our ordered parts, due to lack of product availability. This led to the team having to borrow equipment from university departments, and a subsequent compromise on the specification of the equipment we were using. Although this caused a knock on delay with prototype development, it did allow us to try 3D printing a number of designs for the filter holder and obtain one close to optimal. However, the time delay and change of design resulting from the size of the borrowed equipment hampered our progress somewhat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The other visible change between the two Gantt charts is the more specific allocation of tasks as the project developed. This was primarily due to the team becoming more apt at splitting up tasks, as we got a better idea of the strengths of individual members.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                  On the whole our management of the project was mostly successful, with each member of the team contributing their own ideas and completing their tasks ahead of time. Our principal regret was the lost time waiting for the equipment to arrive from suppliers (that eventually never arrived). One thing we have learnt from this is to keep in contact regularly with external companies, be that equipment suppliers or WaterScope, as their plans may change without them informing all those affected, leading to loss of time efficiency.

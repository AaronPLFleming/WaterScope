Show an early prototype and demonstrate feasibility. Present progress, flag issues and steps taken to overcome them.
  - Development of design
  - User based design
  - Modular design
  - Updated requirements/information from WaterScope
Progress/evolution of prototypes
  - Design stages
  - Production (printing)
  - Problems integrated into each prototype (i.e. we made this, had these problems and so then made this)
Other Issues
  - Parts not arriving
  - Getting parts from waterscope
  - Chemistry dept. trip
Features of final prototype as it stands
  - Connection between parts (modular)
  - Interfaces designed to work with different parts (water bottles, biek pumps etc.)	 
Summary of team members' personal and technical development (what have you learnt so far and how have you learned it?) 
  - 3D printing
  - CAD drawing
  - Website Design
  - Laser cutting
Update the project development time-line and present a plan for completion 
  - Updated Gant chart (including if we are currently on schedule?)
  - Next stages in development 
  - Possible problems that may occur
  - Updated aims for completion

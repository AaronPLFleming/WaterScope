            <h2>About Waterscope</h2>
            <p>WaterScope is a small company formed in 2015 to attempt to combat the lack of access to safe drinking water. Currently, waterborne diseases from bacteria results in over 2.2 million deaths per year - the aim of WaterScope is to devise a simple, fast, water testing kit which can be used to quantitatively test water sources on site for bacterial levels within a few hours.</p>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>As part of this testing kit, water is ﬁltered through an extremely ﬁne ﬁlter, which collects (some of) the bacteria. However, the current system (using a syringe) is slow and energetic, and therefore unsuitable for widespread use by people of a variety of strengths and abilities etc. The task of our team is to design a mechanism for ﬁltering that allows a more rapid, and easier, method of passing the required volume of water (≈ 100ml) through the ﬁlter.</p>
            <p>A second issue regarding this system is cost. While the overall testing apparatus can be of a reasonable cost (several £100), the components used for ﬁltering (which, since they require sterility, are designed to be disposable) must be very cheap. This makes the current solution of a syringe impractical, since even the relatively low cost of a syringe (≈ 50p) is prohibitive.</p>
            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>The second idea, and the idea which the WaterScope team recommended that we pursue, was to design a vacuum ﬁltering system. We decided that it would be relatively feasible to design a cheap vacuum pump that is cheap and easy to manufacture, ideally in-country, as well as a sealed interface between ﬁlter and collection vessel. We plan to use a glass ﬂask as our collection vessel for now, in the understanding that modiﬁcations could be made relatively easily in the future by the WaterScope team if a glass ﬂask proves to be impractical. The beneﬁt of this solution is, in theory, its low cost since the pump and ﬂask both lie downstream of the ﬁlter (as well as large portions of our proposed interface system), they are not required to be disposable and therefore are permitted to be more expensive.</p>

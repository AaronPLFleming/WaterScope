              <h2>Project Management (Sajan)</h2>
              <p>
                  Management of the tasks required for a successful project with WaterScope was crucial, especially as we had a large group size. We decided to create a Gantt Chart during the first week, so that we could allocate the tasks evenly and set achievable deadlines for the members of the group. This was then uploaded to our collaborative online space GitHub, such that it could clearly be seen and the changes tracked by all group members. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Gantt Chart was updated intermittently during group discussions, and <b>milestone updates can be found available on our <a href = "https://github.com/AaronPLFleming/WaterScope">GitHub repository</a> with the date created</b>. The final week of the project involved a large deal of collaborative work when testing and modelling the prototype, so there was less of a definitive task split between the group.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <b>Key differences between the initial plan set out and the updated Gantt Chart (these can be seen in dark green on the updated Gantt Chart):</b>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                    There was a delay of 4 days in the arrival of our ordered parts, due to lack of product availability. This led to the team having to borrow equipment from university departments, and a subsequent compromise on the specification of the equipment we were using. Although this caused a knock on delay with prototype development, it did allow us to try 3D printing a number of designs for the filter holder and obtain one close to optimal. However, the time delay and change of design resulting from the size of the borrowed equipment hampered our progress somewhat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The other visible change between the two Gantt charts is the more specific allocation of tasks as the project developed. This was primarily due to the team becoming more apt at splitting up tasks, as we got a better idea of the strengths of individual members.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                  On the whole our management of the project was mostly successful, with each member of the team contributing their own ideas and completing their tasks ahead of time. Our principal regret was the lost time waiting for the equipment to arrive from suppliers (that eventually never arrived). One thing we have learnt from this is to keep in contact regularly with external companies, be that equipment suppliers or WaterScope, as their plans may change without them informing all those affected, leading to loss of time efficiency.

              <h2>Team Work Strategy (Monica)</h2>
              <p>
                As we had a group of five, it was important from the beginning that we had a clear team work strategy. Throughout the course of the project, we communicated through a Slack channel in order to update each other on our progress and to organize team meetings (outside of the pre-scheduled sessions). 
                <br>A GitHub repository was set up to share all of our work and keep track of all changes; it is open to the public and can be found <a href = "https://github.com/AaronPLFleming/WaterScope">here</a>. GitHub also hosts this website.
              </p>
              <p>
                After each deadline, we would organize a meeting to plan divide up the work needed to do before the next deadline, following our Gantt chart, which can be found on our GitHub repository.
                <br> Work for the presentations and any reports were divided up as evenly as possible and aligned with the corresponding skills and strengths of each team member. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall our team work strategy was successful; communication was high throughout the course of the project, which allowed us to effectively divide our workload without too much unnecessary overlap between each team member.

                <p>
                  This project set out with one main aim, given to us by WaterScope; to create a device that would allow proof of concept for vacuum filtration in the system previously designed by WaterScope. As part of working alongside WaterScope, we also set ourselves an additional goal: for this device to be modular, that is, both compatible with potential future work to be completed by WaterScope and the ability to be easily adapted to other materials and parts in the event that the parts we are working with become unavailable.
                  <br>In these aims, we believe we have succeeded. As outlined in a variety of sections throughout this website, our final design achieved this proof of concept with maximal compatibility with WaterScope. Other designs which may be less compatible with the current WaterScope system, but which we believe offer greater modularity for users in-country with potentially limited resources are also detailed. Technical evaluation of the former was completed to the extent that time allowed, and our “Looking Forward” section outlines some of the ways that our system could be adapted in the future. Together, we hope that this will provide sufficient information for WaterScope to selectively implement the appropriate aspects of our design.                  
                </p>
                <p>
                  So how could our work have been improved? Time was the primary constraint of this project, and it is possible that by being more prepared for problems (particularly early in the project), more time could have been created to perform additional testing and potential implementation of some of our ideas of changes for future designs. For example, we were unable to source a vacuum flask early in the project, which was fixed by borrowing equipment from the Chemistry Department, but being more prepared for problems such as this could have saved valuable time.
                  <br>Collaboration within our team and with WaterScope was good, but in hindsight, it would have been beneficial to have organised meetings with WaterScope earlier in the project to receive parts and to consult on early prototypes. In order to focus our testing to be more useful in the future, it also would have been helpful to have been able to test some water samples of the quality that the system will be dealing with during testing - WaterScope informed us that the water is usually of a relatively similar quality to tap water, but it would have been helpful to confirm this for increased utility of testing.

This project set out with one main aim, given to us by WaterScope; to create a device that would allow proof of concept for vacuum filtration in the system previously designed by WaterScope. As part of working alongside WaterScope, we also set ourselves an additional goal: for this device to be modular, that is, both compatible with potential future work to be completed by WaterScope and the ability to be easily adapted to other materials and parts in the event that the parts we are working with become unavailable.
In these aims, we believe we have succeeded. As outlined in a variety of sections throughout this website, our final design achieved this proof of concept with maximal compatibility with WaterScope. Other designs which may be less compatible with the current WaterScope system, but which we believe offer greater modularity for users in-country with potentially limited resources are also detailed. Technical evaluation of the former was completed to the extent that time allowed, and our “Looking Forward” section outlines some of the ways that our system could be adapted in the future. Together, we hope that this will provide sufficient information for WaterScope to selectively implement the appropriate aspects of our design.

So how could our work have been improved? Time was the primary constraint of this project, and it is possible that by being more prepared for problems (particularly early in the project), more time could have been created to perform additional testing and potential implementation of some of our ideas of changes for future designs. For example, we were unable to source a vacuum flask early in the project, which was fixed by borrowing equipment from the Chemistry Department, but being more prepared for problems such as this could have saved valuable time.
Collaboration within our team and with WaterScope was good, but in hindsight, it would have been beneficial to have organised meetings with WaterScope earlier in the project to receive parts and to consult on early prototypes. In order to focus our testing to be more useful in the future, it also would have been helpful to have been able to test some water samples of the quality that the system will be dealing with during testing - WaterScope informed us that the water is usually of a relatively similar quality to tap water, but it would have been helpful to confirm this for increased utility of testing.

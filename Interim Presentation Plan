Show an early prototype and demonstrate feasibility. Present progress, flag issues and steps taken to overcome them.
Katie: Development of design
User based design
Modular design
Updated requirements/information from WaterScope
Go through the UNICEF principles and talk about how we are adhering to them? E.g. the people in Tanzania can use their own bike pumps and etc?
Aaron: Progress of prototype
Design
Production (printing)
Problems integrated into each prototype (i.e. we made this, had these problems and so then made this)
Other Issues
Parts not arriving
Getting parts from waterscope
Chemistry dept. trip
Final prototype as it stands
Connection between parts (modular)
Interfaces designed to work with different parts (water bottles, bike pumps etc.)	
Nathan: Areas for future development from Waterscope- Prototype to final product. 
Interface with filter paper
needs to be sterile and more conducive to vacuum filtration
New, more cost effective vacuum chamber 
Sample collection- fewer disposable parts, easier collection from source. 
Pump- how to make the design compatible with multiple types of pump  
Monica: Summary of team members' personal and technical development (what have you learnt so far and how have you learned it?) 
3D printing (IdeaWork, Ultimaker)
CAD drawing (Sketchup, Solidworks)
Website Design
Laser cutting, Drilling, Microscopy
Rapid prototyping
Git, Slack, Google powerpoint
Saj? Update the project development time-line and present a plan for completion 
Updated Gantt chart (including if we are currently on schedule?)
Next stages in development 
Possible problems we see happening
Updated aims for completion

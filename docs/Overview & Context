\section Overview & Context (Aaron)
WaterScope is a small company, founded in 2015 in order to try and combat the water inequality that exists in today's world. Currently, around a tenth of the world's population is affected by the issue of contaminated drinking water, and globally, more than 2.2 million people die per year due to water-related diseases.
However, current water testing systems are slow, expensive and difficult to operate, and so are largely inaccessible to the majority of communities that require it the most.
In order to attempt to combat this water inequality that exists globally, WaterScope have attempted to design a new water testing kit, which will be faster, cheaper, and simpler to operate than most currently available testing systems.

                                This was selected as a basic component deisgned to achieve the bare minimum, but proved to be the perfect component for the design aims, being cheap, simple to operate, sturdy and widely compatible.

                                Another avenue explored was that of re-purposing a standard bike pump, but as our current pump achieved the desired purpose perfectly, this was not explored further. It would, however, be a cheap and simple modification to a simple bike pump.

                                This is a non-essential component - since sufficient vacuum can be extremely easily generated, measuring the vacuum is largely not required. Additionally, it is easy to assess strength of vacuum according to how difficult the hand pump is to operate.

                                This is the most expensive component of our design, but since it is reusable (without sterilisation), this was not a prohibitive cost.

                                The flow rates can be found in the <a href = "#testing">Testing of Solution</a> section; these were slower than with our previous designs, which used a 3D-printed component, but this faster flow was sacrificed in order to ensure maximal compatibility with WaterScope.

                        <h3>Solution Progression</h3>
                        <p>
                            Early development and testing of the design was completed with a custom 3D-printed Water Filtration Unit. These parts were designed with several features in mind, in line with the aims of the project, including modularity (ease of compatibility with a variety of water containers) and producing a good seal with the vacuum flask.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An entire history of prototypes can be found on GitHub <a href = "https://github.com/AaronPLFleming/WaterScope/tree/master/Models">here</a>, and an example of a late design is shown below. This evolution demonstrates an iterative design process in which issues were isolated as they arose and dealt with individually.
                        </p>
                        <div class = "row">

                            Early testing with late versions of this custom part were extremely promising. Since the custom part had achieved its primary aim of proving the concept of vacuum filtration was indeed possible in this case, a decision was made to make a change in design to one that would provide maximal compatibility (and therefore hopefully maximal utility) for WaterScope.
                            This did lead to a decrease in filtration rate, but this was deemed to be an acceptable loss of rate in comparison to the gain in later utility for WaterScope.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It may be worth mentioning, however, that, if water filtration rate becomes a key factor (for example, with particularly turbid water), the solution proposed by our team may not be the optimal one - it may be worthwhile for WaterScope to consider a change of design towards some of the prototypes that we have constructed, since they remain modular (being easily compatible with any water bottle and vacuum flask) and may ultimately achieve better results.

                            Tests on both pressure and turbidity were performed on the final design in order to obtain some quantitative results on its performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important to note that the following results are meant to give a <b>rough</b> idea of a relationship between the prototype performance, vacuum pressure and water turbidity; it is not meant to be conclusive as not all variables could not be controlled to laboratory standard. For example, the composition of tap water can vary depending on the temperature of the water or nature of the pipes. However, tap water was the most convenient source to use and was sufficiently different to Cam water to make some meaningful conclusions.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Pressure</h3>
                        <div class="row section-container-spacer">

                                        To test how pressure affects the time it takes to pull water through the filter, the prototype was tested with 100 mL of tap water at an 8, 10 and 12 psi negative pressure difference from atmospheric pressure, which is about 14.7 psi.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The graphs and table below show the results of these tests. The curves on the left seem to follow a linear relationship; however, it can be seen that over time, the flow rate through the filter decreases, which is likely due to impurities in the tap water clogging up the filter.
                                        <br> The graph on the right suggests that there is <b>approximately</b> a 1 minute increase in time per unit psi decrease in pressure difference. However, this is a very loose assertion as there are only three data points, but the aim here is just to give some rough numbers on the relationship between pressure and time.
                                    </p>

                                    As expected, the 12 psi pressure difference resulted in the quickest time to filter 100 mL of tap water. Although WaterScope's current method using the syringe took less time to filter the water, our current prototype has many advantages over WaterScope's current design, as explained in the previous section and in the <a href = "./going-forward.html">End User Perspective</a> section.

                                        As shown in the graph to the left, there is a linear relationship between absorbance levels and concentration, which is what we would expect at these levels of absorption.
                                        These results confirm that the dilutions were performed correctly.

                                    The graph to the right shows the results of testing the diluted samples with the prototype. The three least diluted samples were capped at 20 minutes because in these cases, the flow rate had decreased to just 1 mL every two minutes.

                                    It can be seen on the graph that after some time, each curve saturates to a particular volume level as the flow rate continues to decrease. This is due to the impurities in the water clogging up the filter. With further analysis and tests, these curves could be used to determine the volume of water that can be pushed through the filter given a turbidity value. This information would be incredibly valuable to the user of this prototype because one could easiliy figure out how much a water source would need to be diluted (if at all) in order to filter through 100 mL.

                                    The results to the left suggest that if the water source being used is as dirty as Cam water, if diluted with clean tap water to about a 1/16 fraction, it would be able to be filtered at a reasonable rate. However, it is very likely that the water sources that WaterScope will be testing is much closer to tap water than Cam water.

                                    The total cost of the prototype created on this project was mis-representative as many of the parts were borrowed or loaned from WaterScope and other Engineering departments. However, the tables below give the cost of recreating this filtering solution using equivalent substitute parts readily available on the market. This gives an initial fixed set-up cost of £33.25 and an ongoing variable cost of between 5p and 50p per use, depending on whether the syringe and filter holder are disposable or if a cold water sterilisation method is used for the syringe.  If the proposed solution were to be implemented on a larger scale, these costs could be drastically reduced by purchasing items in bulk directly from the wholesaler or manufacturer.

                                    The initial aim was for the filtering to cost less than £0.50 per use (the current price for the disposable syringe and filter holder (luer lock)). This requirement has been met, as the suggested solution has a maximum cost per use equal to this, and a minimum cost per use more than 10 times lower than this (&lt;£0.05). Whilst the initial set-up cost is not particularly cheap at £33.25, this could easily be reduced by clever sourcing of materials and bulk buying. Additionally, if after sterilisation the saving on this system is £0.45 per use, it would only take 74 water tests to have saved this much on the variable cost. There are over 900 water sources in some of the camps that WaterScope are testing in, and so this number would be very quickly reached.

                                    The vacuum solution significantly outperforms the current filtering implemented by WaterScope. Early testing of a custom printed prototype showed that 100ml of water could be filtered in under 2.5 minutes, compared to the 15 minutes needed currently. Our final prototype using a luer lock filter holder took slightly longer but was still an impressive improvement. The system slows down with more turbid water samples as expected, but still beats the forward pressure method by some way.

                                    The most significant advantage of the vacuum solution over the current forward pressure method is its ease of use. Forcing water through the syringe is incredibly laborious work and takes an extended period of time. Using the new vacuum system, only a small amount of effort is required at the start to create the vacuum. After this, the filtering system works completely independently due to its tight seal maintaining the vacuum almost perfectly.  This not only has the benefit of making the system accessible to a much wider range of people, but also greatly reduces the effect of long filtration times. This solution makes it possible for the user to complete other tasks whilst the filtration is occurring, such as undertaking multiple filtrations, setting up apparatus, or even collecting more water sources.

                                    The set up and maintenance of the vacuum system is slightly more complicated, due to the presence of more parts. However, these additional parts only require assembling once, and this is very simple to do, as can be seen in our <a href = "./going-forward.html#video">instructional video</a>. The modular architecture also helps simplify cleaning, and the replacement or repairs of any parts.

                                    Overall, the benefits of the new system in price, performance and ease of use far outweigh the slight inconvenience of assembly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Hand Pump - This was selected as a basic component deisgned to achieve the bare minimum, but proved to be the perfect component for the design aims, being cheap, simple to operate, sturdy and widely compatible.
            - Another avenue explored was that of re-purposing a standard bike pump, but as our current pump achieved the desired purpose perfectly, this was not explored further. It would, however, be a cheap and simple modification to a pump.
- Vacuum Gauge - This is a non-essential component - since sufficient vacuum can be extremely easily generated, measuring the vacuum is largely not required. Additionally, it is easy to assess strength of vacuum according to how difficult the hand pump is to operate.
- Vacuum Flask - Could be replaced by a more resiliant plastic flask.
               - This is the most expensive component of our design, but since it is reusable (without sterilisation), this was not a prohibitive cost.
               - Includes bung with a drilled hole of suitable size for the water filtration unit.
- Water Filtration Unit - This final design was selected in order to be the most compatible with the other work that WaterScope has done.
                        - The flow rates can be found in the "Testing of Solution" section; These were slower than with our previous designs, which used a 3D-printed component, but this faster flow was sacrificed in order to ensure maximal compatibility with WaterScope.

\subsection Solution Progression
Early development and testing of the design was completed with a custom 3D-printed Water Filtration Unit. These parts were designed with several features in mind, in line with the aims of the project, including modularity (ease of compatibility with a variety of water containers) and producing a good seal with the vacuum flask.
An entire history of prototypes can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/AaronPLFleming/WaterScope/models, and an example of a late design is shown below. This evolution demonstrates an iterative design process in which issues were isolated as they arose and dealt with individually.

Early testing with late versions of this custom part were extremely promising. Since the custom part had achieved its primary aim of proving the concept of vacuum filtration was indeed possible in this case, a decision was made to make a change in design to one that would provide maximal compatibility (and therefore hopefully maximal utility) for WaterScope.
This did lead to a decrease in filtration rate, but this was deemed to be an acceptable loss of rate in comparison to the gain in later utility for WaterScope.
It may be worth mentioning, however, that, if water filtration rate becomes a key factor (for example, with particularly turbid water), the final solution proposed by our team may not be the optimal one - it may be worthwhile for WaterScope to consider a change of design towards some of the prototypes that we have constructed, since they remain modular (being easily compatible with any water bottle and vacuum flask) and may ultimately achieve better results.

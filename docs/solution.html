                            Tests on both pressure and turbidity were performed on the final design in order to obtain some quantitative results on its performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important to note that the following results are meant to give a <b>rough</b> idea of a relationship between the prototype performance, vacuum pressure and water turbidity; it is not meant to be conclusive as not all variables could not be controlled to laboratory standard. For example, the composition of tap water can vary depending on the temperature of the water or nature of the pipes. However, tap water was the most convenient source to use and was sufficiently different to Cam water to make some meaningful conclusions.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Pressure</h3>
                        <div class="row section-container-spacer">
                            <div class = "col-md-12">

                                        To test how pressure affects the time it takes to pull water through the filter, the prototype was tested with 100 mL of tap water at an 8, 10 and 12 psi negative pressure difference from atmospheric pressure, which is about 14.7 psi.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The graphs and table below show the results of these tests. The curves on the left seem to follow a linear relationship; however, it can be seen that over time, the flow rate through the filter decreases, which is likely due to impurities in the tap water clogging up the filter.
                                        <br> The graph on the right suggests that there is <b>approximately</b> a 1 minute increase in time per unit psi decrease in pressure difference. However, this is a very loose assertion as there are only three data points, but the aim here is just to give some rough numbers on the relationship between pressure and time.
                                    </p>

                                    As expected, the 12 psi pressure difference resulted in the quickest time to filter 100 mL of tap water. Although WaterScope's current method using the syringe took less time to filter the water, our current prototype has many advantages over WaterScope's current design, as explained in the previous section and in the <a href = "./going-forward.html">End User Perspective</a> section.

                                        To test the relationship between the prototype performance and the turbidity of the water sample, the prototype was tested with water samples from the River Cam with serial dilutions with tap water. 1 in 2 serial dilutions were used (dilution factors of 1/1 (pure Cam water), 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16).

                                        Wavelengths of 230 nm and 260 nm are commonly used wavelengths used to measure nucleic acids and proteins; hence, they were used to show evidence of living or formerly living organisms in the sample.

                                        As shown in the graph to the left, there is a linear relationship between absorbance levels and concentration, which is what we would expect at these levels of absorption.
                                        These results confirm that the dilutions were performed correctly.

                                    The graph to the right shows the results of testing the diluted samples with the prototype. The three least diluted samples were capped at 20 minutes because in these cases, the flow rate had decreased to just 1 mL every two minutes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It can be seen on the graph that after some time, each curve saturates to a particular volume level as the flow rate continues to decrease. This is due to the impurities in the water clogging up the filter. With further analysis and tests, these curves could be used to determine the volume of water that can be pushed through the filter given a turbidity value. This information would be incredibly valuable to the user of this prototype because one could easiliy figure out how much a water source would need to be diluted (if at all) in order to filter through 100 mL.

                                    The results to the left suggest that if the water source being used is as dirty as Cam water, if diluted with clean tap water to about a 1/16 fraction, it would be able to be filtered at a reasonable rate. However, it is very likely that the water sources that WaterScope will be testing is much closer to tap water than Cam water.
